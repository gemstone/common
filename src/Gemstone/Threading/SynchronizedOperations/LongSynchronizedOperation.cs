/// <remarks>
/// The action performed by the <see cref="LongSynchronizedOperation"/> is executed on
/// its own dedicated thread when running the operation in the foreground asynchronously.
/// When running on its own thread, the action is executed in a tight loop until all
/// pending operations have been completed. This type of synchronized operation should
/// be preferred if operations may take a long time, block the thread, or put it to sleep.
/// It is also recommended to prefer this type of operation if the speed of the operation
/// is not critical or if completion of the operation is critical, such as when saving data
/// to a file.
